        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Gnocchi is simple to make with just three ingredients: mashed potato, flour, and egg. This recipe is one my family has used for generations.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Potatoes</strong> - Use starchy potatoes, such as russets.</li>
            <li><strong>Flour</strong> - All-purpose flour absorbs moisture and helps create gluten.</li>
            <li><strong>Egg</strong> - An egg lends moisture and acts as a binder, which means it helps hold the dumplings together.</li>
        </ul>
